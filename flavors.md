# Flavors of Software Transparency Documents

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
cache invalidation and naming things.”

Attributed to Phil Karlton circa 1996

This writeup is my attempt at clarifying
the flavors of documents under discussion
in the NTIA Software Transparency
Multistakeholder Working Group.
I am purposely not using the word "SBOM" yet
because it is clear to me that different stakeholders
have different assumptions on the which 'flavor'
of document is meant by that term.
I.e. SBOM one of the flavors that needs
clarification and we need either qualifiers
or different terms to distinguish the 'flavors'.

I believe that we will talk past each other less,
if we understand 'which flavor' is under discussion
and what use case it is being used in.

Flavor examples where clarification would be beneficial:
- ingredients only
- assembly instructions
- component to license relationships
- known-unknowns
- component to vulnerability relationships
- "finished goods" "affected/not-affected" relationship to vulnerability
- has ingredients but not 'sufficient' for "SBOM baseline"
- has insufficient data for a particular use case (many examples which will need to be un-confounded)

I would argue this is the source of much of our talking past each other,
and that having 'document names' will allow us to better reach consensus on many other topics.

## First Principles
This is just Duncan's opinion.
Assume "IMHO" on every sentence.
Don't mistake passion for intransigence -
change my opinion by presenting alternatives
and reasoning - particularly with use cases/scenarios.
I recognize my experiences prejudice me
and I recognize
there are use cases
beyond the ones I have considered.
Everyone has to operate in their
own frame of reference.
Broaden my mind by alerting me
to your frame of reference.

This writeup has only two parties involved,
the producer of the document,
and the consumer of the document.
They may be the same
(i.e. document is for internal consumption).
The component producer is a 3rd party from
this writeup's perspective.
The document producer may or may not be the
component producer.
This writeup allows for other-than-component-producer
creating relevant documents.
"Authority" to produce a document,
and 'trust' of that document are out of scope for this writeup.

Everything in this writeup assumes
the document producer
and the document consumer
have a sufficient trust relationship
for the use cases.
How that is achieved is outside the scope of this writeup.

Everything in this writeup assumes
the document producer
has sufficient data to produce the document accurately.
Incompleteness is addressed but inaccuracy and integrity
are outside the scope of this writeup.

This writeup assumes parties in the use case,
and only the parties in the use case,
have access to the document.
How confidentiality is achieved,
(and what level of confidentiality
is appropriate) is out-of-scope.

TL;DR confidentiality, integrity, availability are beyond scope of naming
which documents we are talking about in this writeup -
albeit they will introduce more
flavors once they are addressed.
